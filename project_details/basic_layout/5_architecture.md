# Architecture 
The Dewey Decimal Discord Bot is designed using a multi-layered architecture to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability. The architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Client Layer**
2. **Application Layer**
3. **Data Layer**
4. **Integration Layer**

---

## Client Layer
**Description:** This layer represents the user interface where users interact with the bot through Discord. It handles user commands and responses.

**Components:**
- **Discord Client:** The interface through which users interact with the bot using Discord commands.

**Responsibilities:**
- Receive and interpret user commands.
- Display responses and information to users.
- Provide user feedback and error messages.

**Breakdown:**
- **Discord Client:**
  - Utilizes `discord.py` to connect to Discord.
  - Handles events such as receiving messages and commands.
  - Sends responses back to the Discord server.

## Application Layer
**Description:** This layer contains the core logic and functionality of the bot, including command handling, business logic, and interactions with other layers.

**Components:**
1. **Command Handler:** Manages the various commands issued by the users and routes them to the appropriate functions.
2. **Business Logic:** Implements the core functionalities such as adding books, searching for references, generating reports, and validating inputs.
3. **Error Handler:** Provides detailed and actionable error messages to users.
4. **Onboarding Module:** Guides new users through initial setup and familiarizes them with the bot's commands.

**Responsibilities:**
- Process user commands and execute corresponding actions.
- Handle business logic for library management.
- Ensure proper flow of data between the client layer and the data layer.

**Breakdown:**
- **Command Handler:**
  - Maps user commands to functions.
  - Validates user input and handles errors.
  - Coordinates with business logic for processing commands.
- **Business Logic:**
  - Implements book logging by interacting with the data layer.
  - Generates reports by fetching data from the database.
  - Manages user preferences and ensures they are stored correctly.
- **Error Handler:**
  - Extends error handling to provide detailed messages and suggestions for resolving common mistakes.
- **Onboarding Module:**
  - Implements an interactive setup process, helping users configure key settings and become familiar with the bot.

## Data Layer
**Description:** This layer is responsible for data storage, retrieval, and management. It interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations.

**Components:**
1. **Database (Azure SQL):** Stores book references and other relevant information.
2. **Data Access Objects (DAO):** Interfaces for interacting with the database.
3. **Data Management Module:** Handles data backup, export, and integrity.

**Responsibilities:**
- Store and retrieve book data.
- Ensure data integrity and security.
- Manage database schema and perform necessary migrations.

**Breakdown:**
- **Database (Azure SQL):**
  - Stores book references, categories, and other metadata.
  - Uses tables with fields such as `id`, `title`, `dewey_decimal`, `category`, and `description`.
- **Data Access Objects (DAO):**
  - Provides methods for CRUD operations.
  - Ensures data is stored and retrieved efficiently.
  - Handles database connections and queries.
- **Data Management Module:**
  - Manages regular data backups and supports CSV export functionality.
  - Ensures data integrity through regular checks and automated cleaning processes.

## Integration Layer
**Description:** This layer handles integration with external services such as generative AI for report generation and NLU for understanding user input.

**Components:**
1. **Generative AI (OpenAI GPT):** Generates summary reports and insights from book data.
2. **NLU Model (SpaCy or NLTK):** Processes and understands user inputs for better interaction.

**Responsibilities:**
- Integrate with external APIs and services.
- Process and analyze data using AI and NLU models.
- Ensure seamless communication between the application layer and external services.

**Breakdown:**
- **Generative AI (OpenAI GPT):**
  - Generates natural language reports based on library data.
  - Integrates via API calls, processing data and returning summaries.
- **NLU Model (SpaCy or NLTK):**
  - Processes user inputs to understand and correct errors in book titles or categories.
  - Enhances user interaction by providing accurate responses based on natural language understanding.

## Updated Architecture Overview

1. **Command Aliases:**
   - Implement an alias resolution system within the command handler.
   - Maps alias commands (e.g., `/add`) to their respective full commands (e.g., `/add_book`).

2. **Book Categorization:**
   - Update the database schema to include a category field.
   - Modify the command handler to accept and store categories when logging books.

3. **Report Generation:**
   - Add a reporting function that aggregates books by category and generates a summary report.
   - Trigger this function via the `/summary` command.

4. **Data Backup/Export Feature:**
   - Implement a backup and export system to handle exporting the Azure SQL database to a CSV file.
   - Ensure data integrity during export.

5. **Customization of Responses:**
   - Add a user preferences component to store settings like preferred response style (e.g., formal, casual) and language preference (English or Spanish).
   - Adjust responses based on user preferences.

6. **Automated Data Cleaning:**
   - Enhance the data validation module to regularly check for duplicates or anomalies in the data.
   - Notify users to review and correct any flagged entries.

7. **Interactive Setup Process:**
   - Develop an onboarding module that guides new users through the initial setup process.
   - Ensure the onboarding process is available in both English and Spanish.

8. **Robust Testing Framework:**
   - Expand the testing suite to cover new features, especially edge cases and varied user inputs.
   - Regularly update test cases to ensure continued stability as the bot evolves.

9. **NLP Integration:**
   - Include an NLP module in the command handler to process natural language inputs.
   - Map user phrases to corresponding commands, allowing conversational interaction.

10. **User Interaction Flow:**
    - Support a dynamic flow that adapts to user inputs in natural language.
    - Ensure smooth interactions with suggestions and feedback in the user's preferred language.

11. **Security Enhancements:**
    - Implement token management using environment variables.
    - Ensure HTTPS is used for secure communication.
    - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other security risks.

12. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
    - Use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.
