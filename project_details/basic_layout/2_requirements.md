# Requirements

## Functional Requirements
1. The bot must allow users to add references using a predefined format.
2. The bot must validate user input before adding a reference to the database.
3. The bot must support searching for references within a specified Dewey Decimal range.
4. The bot must display a list of all stored references when requested by the user.
5. The bot must provide meaningful feedback messages for successful and failed operations.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. The bot should have a response time of less than 2 seconds for all operations.
2. The system should handle up to 100 concurrent users without performance degradation.
3. The bot should be available 99.9% of the time.
4. Error messages should be user-friendly and informative.

## Software Requirements
1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. `discord.py` library for Discord bot development
3. `pyodbc` library for SQL database connectivity
4. Azure SQL Database for persistent storage
5. A cloud platform (Azure App Service or equivalent) for deployment

## Technical Requirements
1. The bot must connect to an Azure SQL database using secure credentials.
2. The bot must use a predefined schema for storing references.
3. The system should log all operations and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.
4. The bot should be containerized for easy deployment and scaling.

## Libraries
1. `discord.py` – For Discord bot interaction
2. `pyodbc` – For connecting and executing SQL queries on Azure SQL
3. `logging` – For logging bot activities and errors
4. `pytest` – For unit testing

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests must be written for all major functions, including input parsing, database insertion, and retrieval.
2. Integration tests must ensure that the bot interacts correctly with the Azure SQL database.
3. Manual testing must be performed for edge cases and invalid inputs.
4. Performance testing must ensure that the bot meets non-functional requirements.

## Quality Assurance Requirements
1. Code must follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style.
2. All code must be reviewed by at least one peer before merging.
3. A continuous integration pipeline must be set up to run tests on each commit.
4. Documentation must be provided for all functions and modules.

## Security Requirements
1. Database credentials must be stored securely and not hardcoded.
2. The bot must sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. The bot must use HTTPS for all external communications.
4. Access to the database must be restricted to the bot’s IP address.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python (`discord.py`)
- **Database:** Azure SQL Database
- **Deployment:** Azure App Service
- **Version Control:** GitHub and Gitlab for project management and collaboration

## Future Enhancements
- **Exporting Library Data:** Allow users to export the library data to a CSV file.
- **Advanced Search:** Implement additional search filters (e.g., by category or title).
- **User Authentication:** Add user-specific libraries using Discord IDs.
- **Web Interface:** Develop a simple web interface for non-Discord users to view and manage the library.
